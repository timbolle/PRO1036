  abstract = {Get going with tidymodels, a collection of R packges for modeling and machine learning. Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience with modeling, this practical introduction shows data analysts, business analysts, and data scientists how the tidymodels framework offers a consistent, flexible approach for your work. RStudio engineers Max Kuhn and Julia Silge demonstrate ways to create models by focusing on an R dialect called the tidyverse. Software that adops tidyverse principles shares both a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so learning one piece of the ecosystem makes it easier to learn the next. You'll understand why the tidymodels framework has been built to be used by a broad range of people},

With this fully updated edition, developers and data scientists will learn how to bundle reusable R functions, sample data, and documentation together by applying the package development philosophy used by the team that maintains the "tidyverse" suite of packages. In the process, you'll learn how to automate common development tasks using a set of R packages, including devtools, usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.  Authors Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan from Posit (formerly known as RStudio) help you create packages quickly, then teach you how to get better over time. You'll be able to focus on what you want your package to do as you progressively develop greater mastery of the structure of a package.  With this book, you will: Learn the key components of an R package, including code, documentation, and tests Streamline your development process with devtools and the RStudio IDE Get tips on effective habits such as organizing functions into files Get caught up on important new features in the devtools ecosystem Learn about the art and science of unit testing, using features in the third edition of testthat Turn your existing documentation into a beautiful and user friendly website with pkgdown Gain an appreciation of the benefits of modern code hosting platforms, such as GitHub},
